# Hosting your Gigapixel through Amazon Web Services

Before you can begin this process, you wil need to have generated Zoomify images. You can learn more about how to make one [here](https://storymap.knightlab.com/gigapixel/).

Note: While Amazon supports free web hosting through its Free Tier option, after a year, you will have to pay to use their hosting services. It's relatively cheap (~$.03 / month for 1 GB, using their [pricing calculator](https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), but if you want an entirely free option, you can check out our GitHub hosting tutorial.

1. Sign up to create an account on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

2. Once your account has been created, choose the [quickstart web hosting option](https://console.aws.amazon.com/quickstart-website/new) on your dashboard.

3. On your computer, navigate to the folder where you've stored your Gigapixel tiles. Inside the directory, create an empty file called 'index.html.'

6. Amazon will spend ~15 minutes to publish your Gigapixel to their servers, but once Amazon is done, they will provide you a link to your hosted webpage.
